Do you know how much twelve days of food weighs? I don’t. I stubbornly refused to find out, my pack bulging at the seams with every last calorie I could cram into it. I figured if I didn’t know how heavy it was, it would feel lighter. But now, staring at my towering pack in a Jasper, Alberta, Canada hostel room, I wasn’t even sure if I could lift it, never mind hike over 350 kilometers with it on my back.
