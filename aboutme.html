          <p class="text-muted">I'm a triple crowner (PCT 2016, CDT 2017, AT 2018) with over two decades of backpacking experience. On trail, I go by Fun Size. I love everything from thirty mile days to sitting in a hammock with a beer. In 2019, I hiked Vermont's Long Trail with Chester the nine pound dog, and I'm planning on thru-hiking the Great Divide Trail in 2021.</p>

        <p> I am a long distance adventurer and writer, who loves being outside more than just about anything else. I completed the Triple Crown of hiking in just over two years. I’ve hiked the Pacific Crest Trail, Continental Divide Trail, Appalachian Trail, Long Trail, and many other shorter treks. I love any form of human powered transport, but particularly canoeing, bikepacking, rock climbing, and various types of winter exploration. I have also completed a 24 day raft trip on the Colorado river through the Grand Canyon.  I have lived in Scotland and Alaska, although I now make my home in Canada.  </p>

        <p> I have worked as a writer, editor and communications manager for a diverse set of companies, including book publishers, nonprofits and law firms. My writing has appeared in multiple outdoor publications, including on Dirtbag Diaries and noted thru-hiking website The Trek.  </p>
