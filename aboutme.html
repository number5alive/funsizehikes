          <p class="text-muted">I'm a triple crowner (PCT 2016, CDT 2017, AT 2018) with over two decades of backpacking experience. On trail, I go by Fun Size. I love everything from thirty mile days to sitting in a hammock with a beer. In 2019, I hiked Vermont's Long Trail with Chester the nine pound dog, and I'm planning on thru-hiking the Great Divide Trail in 2021.</p>
