        <p> I am a long distance adventurer and writer, who loves being outside more than just about anything else. I completed the Triple Crown of hiking in just over two years. I’ve hiked the Pacific Crest Trail, Continental Divide Trail, Appalachian Trail, Long Trail, and many other shorter treks. I love any form of human powered transport, but particularly canoeing, bikepacking, rock climbing, and various types of winter exploration. I have also completed a 24 day raft trip on the Colorado river through the Grand Canyon.  I have lived in Scotland and Alaska, although I now make my home in Canada.  </p>

        <p> I have worked as a writer, editor and communications manager for a diverse set of companies, including book publishers, nonprofits and law firms. My writing has appeared in multiple outdoor publications, including on Dirtbag Diaries and noted thru-hiking website The Trek.  </p>
