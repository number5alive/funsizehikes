    <p> I am a long distance adventurer and writer, who loves being outside more than just about anything else. I completed the Triple Crown of hiking in just over two years. I’ve hiked the Pacific Crest Trail, Continental Divide Trail, Appalachian Trail, Long Trail, and many other shorter treks. I love any form of human powered transport, but particularly canoeing, bikepacking, rock climbing, and various types of winter exploration. I have also completed a 24 day raft trip on the Colorado river through the Grand Canyon.  I have lived in Scotland and Alaska, although I now make my home in Canada.  </p>

    <p> I have worked as a writer, editor and communications manager for a diverse set of companies, including book publishers, nonprofits and law firms. My writing has appeared in multiple outdoor publications, including noted thru-hiking website <a href="https://thetrek.co/author/eloise-robbins/">The Trek</a> and will soon be featured on <a href="https://dirtbagdiaries.com/">Dirtbag Diaries</a>.</p>

    <p> You can read about why they call me "Fun Size" in my blog post: <a class="fst-italic" href="/blog/TheyCallMeFunSize.html">How I got my trail name</a>

      text="I’ve been hiking for over two decades. I started backpacking as a teenager in Scotland while completing the Duke of Edinburgh’s award. I hiked the Pacific Crest Trail in 2016, the Continental Divide Trail in 2017 and the Appalachian Trail in 2018. In 2019, I hiked the Long Trail with Chester the nine pound Biewer Terrier. I have continued to hike all over the world, and have completed treks in Alaska, Patagonia, Canada, Scotland, and across the US. In 2021, I plan to hike the Great Divide Trail, a 800 mile route through the Canadian Rockies."

      text="I began canoeing when I moved to Canada in 2019. Despite only having a few years experience, I have already spent well over 30 nights on canoe trips in Algonquin Park. I have also travelled 202 km on a week long between Kingston and Ottawa on the Rideau Canal and canoed down the Yukon River. I enjoy challenging routes with difficult portages (mostly because my husband carries the canoe when we’re not in the water)."

      text="I’m a long time bike commuter and winter cyclist. I particularly love fat biking, mostly in Alaska. I recently made the switch to bikepacking. I made bike bags for myself and husband from scratch, developing my own patterns. Chester the dog enjoys coming along for the ride as well."
