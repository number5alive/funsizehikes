Even when you're traveling solo, seldom are you truly alone. Throughout my trip I've met people in hostels, in classes, in bars. Whether it's a conversation for a few minutes, or a continuation of a ten year friendship, you will meet people. So even if you are on your own, it is difficult to ever be lonely.

No where is this more apparent than in Rome. I arrive after three weeks of Spanish classes in Madrid, where it was easy to make new friends. I show up in Rome ready to be alone for a while, looking forward to exploring the city on my own. Instead, I stumble into a hostel room full of women traveling solo. I talk to a wonderful lady from Turkmenistan, and we quickly determine we have similar plans for tomorrow. It's easy to convince her to walk to the Vatican via a few tourist sites rather than take the Metro.

It's an early start in the morning. The Vatican museums are free on the last Sunday of the month, but only with reduced opening hours. We leave before eight, wandering through Rome's crumbling splendor. Past Trevi Fountain, by the Pantheon and through Piazza Navona, we reach the banks of the Tiber and follow the throngs of people headed to the Vatican. We're greeted by a line of people wrapped around the block. We join the queue and wait patiently. An hour passes, then another, and then we are inside the museum, working our way past mosaics and statues on our way to the Sistine Chapel.
Like all of Europe's great works of art, the Sistine Chapel is spoiled by its fame. Hordes of people crane their necks to look at it, chatting loudly while guards use loudspeakers to demand silence and respect. The irony of blaring requests for silence seems lost on them. The ceiling is stunning though, and in the few moments of silence between announcements, it's easy to see what the fuss is about.

After the chapel, we are funneled out of the museum. We join the (thankfully shorter) line for St. Peter's Basilica. Once inside, my jaw drops. I've been to a lot of churches and cathedrals over my travels, but this one is by far the most spectacular. We explore the church, then head up to the dome. Before looking out over the city, the stairs lead you to the inside of the dome. From the dizzying heights over the alter, the clear voices of a choir ring out, the acoustics bouncing their voices from the dome and filling the air.
The outside is no less breathtaking. From high on the dome, you can look out over the Vatican and see the city of Rome beyond. A rain shower threatens the view, but cannot dampen the beauty.
From the Vatican, it's a long walk back to the hostel, but we break it up by exploring Rome's most famous sites that we skimmed over earlier in order to make it to the museum on time. The Pantheon is stunning from the outside, but it's interior is somewhat of a let down after the Vatican. We sit captivated in front of Trevi fountain for a while though, eating gelato. The sky darkens and the fountain is illuminated.

The next day, we head to the coliseum. The structure is stunning, but the informational displays are underwhelming. I've been spoiled lately, visiting some of the best sites in the world. Get your act together Rome, signs are not that difficult.

After, we wander Palentine hill and the forum. Roses wind between the statues, and seagulls perch on walls, posing for tourists's cameras. We leave, wandering past imposing buildings to the boca de la verita, and back past the Trevi fountain to the hostel.

At the hostel, a Brazilian lady is having a tough night. She misses her home, her family, her boyfriend. I think about my first night in Stirling and how I missed my parents. Traveling to Arizona and missing my friends from Stirling. Returning to Scotland and missing America. Those of us who split our hearts around the world will always be homesick, no matter where we are. It's faded to a dull ache for me, but I emphasize with her tears. We reassure her- it gets easier, it is worth the heartache, think about how you will look back on this experience. We realize we are all women traveling alone and it is empowering. We can turn around what people think we can't do, what we think we can't do. Once you've travelled alone through a foreign country, everything else seems a little easier.

In the morning, I say goodbye to my new friend, promising to visit her in Turkmenistan if I can. Then I head out for a final walk - up to villa Borghese, then down the Spanish steps, and past Trevi one final time. Then I head to the airport, ready to make my way back to America.
