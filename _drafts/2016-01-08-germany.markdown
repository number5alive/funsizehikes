The first thing we see as we leave Munich airport to find a train into the city is a Christmas market. It looks almost identical to the other markets we've seen, but this is finally a real German market.

The train spits us out almost at our accommodations, and we walk into town to find food. At Marienplatz we find a massive market, under the gothic style town hall. We concentrate on finding a restaurant instead of touring the stalls- there will be plenty of time for that later.
The next day, we immediately head out of town. There's fantastic day trips from Munich and we want to make sure we have time for two of them before Alison leaves. We ride the train for two hours towards the Alps. We disembark in Fussen, and then board a bus.
We are spat out in a tiny village with buildings that look like they should be made out of gingerbread. And above, dominating the skyline, is Neuschwanstein Castle. This is the castle to end all castles. The Disney logo is based on it. It looks like someone picked it straight out of a fairytale, and in a way, they did.

We hike up to the castle, and take a tour inside. There we learn about Ludwig II, a reclusive king in the 19th Century, who wished he'd lived hundreds of years earlier. He built Neuschwanstein as a way of fulfilling that wish. He only lived there for a few years, before dying in mysterious circumstances. I'm instantly fascinated by the eccentric King.

The next day, we make our second two hour train trip, this time to Salzburg. Salzburg is perhaps the most beautiful city I've visited, with it's imposing fortress on a hill, standing guard over manicured gardens, quaint bridges across the river, and narrow winding streets. We wander for hours, around Mirabell gardens where the Sound of Music was filmed, up to the fortress, past the houses where Mozart was born and grew up, and into the most impressive cathedral so far. Then, as darkness falls, we turn to the Christmas market. I've lost count of how many markets we have visited, but I'm still not bored of them.

Then it's Alison's last day in Munich. We tour the royal residences, which have been rebuilt after heavy damage in World War II. We visit a beer hall, and then finally the Christmas market. I'll miss traveling with Alison.

After making sure Alison gets on her train, I head to the Englischer garden. There's a man made standing wave on the river there and I watch people surfing it. I know of plenty people who would love something like that in Anchorage. Then I head through the park as the sun breaks through the clouds. I see a pagoda poking through a thicket of trees and head towards it. Between the trees, there is another Christmas market. It is my favorite out of all of the markets I visit- no tourists and none of the mass produced tree ornaments and gingerbread that fill the others.
I round out my time in Munich with a visit to the Deutches museum and plenty of time in the Christmas market. Then, it's off to Scotland for Christmas and New Year.
