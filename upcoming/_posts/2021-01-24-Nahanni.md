While canoeing down the Northwest Territories Nahanni river won’t happen till 2022, I’m already working on my whitewater skills to guarantee a successful trip! Canoeing through rapids and canyons for two weeks might be adventure enough, but I’m hopeful we can also sneak in a trip to the Cirque of the Unclimbables!
