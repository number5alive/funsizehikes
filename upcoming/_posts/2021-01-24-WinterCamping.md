Winter camping has saved my sanity this year. I love snuggling up in my winter sleeping bag, and all the challenges snow brings. I plan to keep camping all year (as long as covid restrictions allow). Algonquin park is our favorite place to go, but I’m excited to explore the few trails in Frontenac Park we haven’t been to, and some crown land too.
