- comment: I think there's something unique here about tackling winter camping from
    a thru-hiker mentality. All the other online groups seem heavy into the hot-tent
    options, and all sorts of equipment and gear. Figuring this out with FunSize has
    been fun, and we're leveraging a lot of our 3-season equipment which makes this
    more approachable. (Though a super warm sleep system seems to be key!)
