- comment: "I too live in Ontario and it\u2019s a challenge to find long distance\
    \ trails and mountains. In Ontario, we have shorter hikes like the La Cloche Silhouette\
    \ and Superior Lake Trails but these can be completed in 4 days or so.  I thru\
    \ hiked the AT at 60 years of age so time is precious. This pandemic has constrained\
    \ my travels and hikes so reading your blog has been wonderful and inspiring.\
    \ Thank you."
