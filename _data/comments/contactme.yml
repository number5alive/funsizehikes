- comment: "Dear\_Eloise\r\n\r\nI hope this email finds you well.\_\r\n\r\nI am currently\
    \ in the process of developing a new travel platform that will be primarily focused\
    \ on adventures and adventure travel, and having read and thoroughly enjoyed a\
    \ number of your articles, I thought\_it would be very worthwhile to get in touch.\r\
    \n\r\nOver the past number of months, we have been refining the concept for a\
    \ new platform 'Mucky' which will be focused on delivering a dedicated channel\
    \ for adventure seekers, highlighting existing but often unexplored travel experiences\
    \ and providing meaningful content to inspire future journeys for others. This\
    \ idea was born from my recent travel experience to the Arctic circle where I\
    \ snorkeled amongst wild Orcas, but it was an experience I came across by chance\
    \ and not something I ever thought to be possible.\r\n\r\nThe first phase of our\
    \ development will be\_centered\_around publishing content in the following key\
    \ sections; Personal Adventure Articles, Advice and Insight Articles. Our overarching\
    \ plan is to\_develop this platform into an online exploration\_ecosystem, enabling\
    \ travellers to engage with likeminded people and have greater access to the information\
    \ they need for future adventures.\r\n\r\nI have been highly impressed by your\
    \ previous articles, including 'How I got my trail name - Fun Size' and 'Which\
    \ Triple Crown Trail is Right For You?'. I do appreciate that this email is out\
    \ of the blue, however I believe we are on track to create something special and\
    \ I would be excited by the prospect of you being onboard to write for us and\
    \ share some of your own experiences.\_\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in this opportunity,\
    \ please let me know and I will forward on our Content Proposal Form. The form\
    \ will also include additional information\_regarding the type of content that\
    \ can be selected for submission and the associated fees.\r\n\r\nI very much look\
    \ forward to hearing from you.\_\r\n\r\nKindest Regards,\_\r\n\r\nRachel\_"
