San Diego is grittier than I expect. I arrive exhausted from an early flight, and from a long few days in Alaska. We petsit a husky and her bulldog friend for four days. She is full of energy, desperate to be outside and run. I have never identified more with an animal. I just want to be on the trail already.

I walk around San Diego. I know I should take it easy, but I'm full of the same restless energy that dogged me in Alaska. I walk up to Balboa park and then down by the bay. I eat Mexican food, burgers and Vietnamese, trying to pack on one last pound before the trail, but it is hard in the heat.

And the heat! I rapidly downgrade how many miles I plan to do for the first few days. I wilt in the sun. Luckily, while the forecast for Thursday is hot, I should have a few days of cool weather after that.

From here on, updates may be few and far between. Jerami may post photos for me occasionally, but don't worry if you don't hear anything for a while.
