I love big cities when I'm in the right mood, but Vegas is the weirdest place I've ever been. We arrive at the hotel at 9pm on a Saturday night and immediately set out to explore. Even before we leave the hotel, it is chaos- lights and people and spinning slot machines. The strip is lit up like Christmas and very disorienting for two people just off the plane from Alaska. People walk past clutching huge boozy slushies in cups the shape of the Eiffel tower, and there are massive fountains everywhere. We buy a cider in an attempt to blend in a little more, but it isn't long before we slink back to the hotel, already ready to leave the city.

The next day, we meet Jerami's mom for lunch.It doesn't take much persuading on her and her husband's part for us to leave the city. A few hours later, we're at Valley of Fire state park and it is a different world. Honeycomb red rocks are everywhere and big horn sheep line the road, keeping a watchful eye on the tourists with their cameras. We park and hike back to the wave, a swirl of red and white rock. It's warm for us, but cloudy- perfect hiking weather after Alaska's cold and rain over the past month.
Today, we drive towards Flagstaff and the Grand Canyon. In just a few days well be floating down the Colorado.
