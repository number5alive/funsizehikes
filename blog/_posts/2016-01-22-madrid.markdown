Madrid feels the most foreign out of all the places I have been so far. There are almost no tourists. Even at the tourist attractions, you are lucky to find someone who speaks English. It lacks the familiar culture of France, Germany or the UK.

I adjust slowly. I can't wait until 10pm to eat dinner, but I do shift it back to 8pm. The first few days, my head buzzes from all of the new Spanish words, but by the end of the week, I'm thinking in Spanish. After two weeks, it takes a conscious effort to switch from broken Spanish to English.

My travelling pace here is very different. Instead of running around, cramming in as much as possible, I take my time and learn my new neighbourhood. I have a favorite place to get coffee, new favorite foods. I still haunt the museums, but I go to the small ones without English translations on their exhibits, as well as the larger, touristy ones. I plan my visit to the Museo Del Prado around its free opening hours and yawn my way around the artworks, glad I didn't pay to enter. Museo Reina Sophia does not have a free time, but I gladly cough up my entrance fee to pour over the works by Picaso and Dali.

Perhaps my favorite though, is my host family. They coach me through Spanish, teaching me almost as much as my classes. They share their culture with me and recomend places to visit, off of the beaten path. But my absolute favorite thing about staying with a Spanish family is the food. Oh, the food! Fried, salty and fatty, heavy on the meat and light on the vegetables, but absolutely delicious! I eat paella, and lentejas, cerdo and calamari. Restaurants pale in comparison to the home cooking of Abuela.
