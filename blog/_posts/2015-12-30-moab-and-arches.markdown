We find bikes to rent in Moab. It's a short drive to a trailhead, with a good mix of trails. We don't read the descriptions too closely and start on a trail named EZ. Turns out that name is not such a great description. Rock is very different to ride on than snow and it takes a little adjusting. By the time we reach the end of that trail, we're feeling a little more comfortable and decide to take a slickrock trail around. It's fun- the trail is super grippy and the scenery is beautiful. We ride until we can't ride anymore.

The next day, we drive to Arches National Park. First, we hike up to Delicate Arch. There's snow and ice on top of the slick rock and it lives up to its name. Next, we head to Devil's Garden, a section of sandstone fins and arches, with giant chasms between the fins. We hike past Landscape Arch, a long, skinny rock formation that defies gravity. Then we scramble up a fin and hike along its back to Double O Arch- two arches balanced on top of each other. We spend the rest of the day exploring the park.

It's getting cold, so we run south, driving, driving, trying to reach somewhere warm to camp for the night. We find a campspot outside of Flagstaff. It's 19 degrees when we wake up in the morning.
We drive through Sedona and Jerome, stopping to hike and explore. Our South West adventure is almost over.
