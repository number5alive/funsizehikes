Zpacks Arc Haul
My pack is without a doubt my favorite piece of gear. So comfortable, durable enough to hold up to an entire thru hike and have enough life left for another, and zpacks customer service has been awesome to me. I love that it is waterproof, even in torrential thunderstorm rain. I wish it was a little smaller, but it is still awesome! Once Girl Pack is ready to retire, I’ll probably try the Zpacks Scout out.

Hyperlite Mountain Gear flat tarp (8.6 x 8.6)
Kept me warm and dry despite torrential rain, hail and snow! I only had problems finding trees to tie off to a few nights. Totally durable enough for a second thru hike too! I'll be picking up a bug net to add to this for the AT. I’m going with the Mountain Laurel designs bug bivvy. I used their bug mid on the PCT and was impressed. This will also mean I can sleep outside my sleeping bag when the trail warms up.

Zpacks 10 degree bag
I did not freeze to death, despite some chilly nights! This bag also held up really well and I love how light it is. I’m starting the AT very early, so I’ll pair it with some down booties to sleep in for the first little while to add some extra warmth.

Montbell Ultralight Jacket
6.4 oz of awesome! The material is not very durable, so Im rocking some awesome patches, but I think this jacket will make it! The warmth to weight ratio is unbeatable. I picked up a cheapo fleece for the AT start for a whole $2.

Steripen Ultra
This thing is still going! Despite being glass and electronic, it just won't die! I did get sick twice on the CDT, but I'm pretty sure once was poor hand washing (my hand sanitizer exploded!) And the other was probably norovirus. So! Long trails 0, Steripen 2.

Frogg Toggs
These things are not durable! But in fairness, army crawling under barbed wire fences would probably wreck any jacket. I love the price point on these and they don't perform any worse than fancy jackets (at least until they are full of holes!) I may supliment with an umbrella on the AT.

Altra lone peaks and dirty girl gaiters
I am way too scared to change this winning combo! I had so few foot problems on the CDT- one blister, minimal plantar fasciitis. This is what works for me and I'm sticking with it. Even if I do keep needing to size up!
