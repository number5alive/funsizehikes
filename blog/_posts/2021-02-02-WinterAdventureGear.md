This is the gear I use for winter camping in Canada. It’s heavy in comparison to my thru hiking set up. But it’s warm, so it’s worth the weight.


My winter backpack is heavy. This is the gear that I use for winter camping in Canada. But it’s warm, so it’s worth the weight. Most of this would be overkill if the temperature was 20f/-7c or higher. Canadian winter nights are long, so we spend more time in camp. We normally bring books, crossword puzzles, or listen to audiobooks in our cozy sleeping bags.
