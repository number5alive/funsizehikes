Twenty four days is a long time to spend in one place. But when each bend of the river reveals a new vista- towering limestone, menacing shist, gentle green slopes - it is hard to be sick of anything. The canyon is full of small, magical moments. The silhouette of a big horn sheep on a ridge line. The spicy-sweet smell of mormon tea. The perfect beauty of Havasu - so wonderful that it looks fake, as surely something that perfect can't exist. The stars winking out one by one as first dawn paints the canyon. Time unspools like an eddy line and a minute, an hour, a day; none of it is long enough to truly get to know the canyon.

The stars winking out one by one as first dawn paints the canyon. Time unspools like an eddy line and a minute, an hour, a day; none of it is long enough to truly get to know the canyon.

It's a long drive to Lee's Ferry, where we'll start our 24 day, 280 mile trip through the Grand Canyon. I'm nervous, perhaps more nervous than I've ever been in my entire life, and it makes me nauseous. Once you're in the Canyon, you're committed. There's only a few places to hike out. There's no changing your mind. And between Lee's Ferry and the take out, there lies bigger white water than anything I've seen before in my life.
We rig our blue, 18 foot rafts, piling on food and water jugs, tables, stoves and everything else that 12 people could possibly need for three and a half weeks. We float just a few hundred feet down stream in the gathering dusk and set up our tents for the night.
In the morning, after our ranger orientation, we re-rig our boats and start to head down stream. A few miles down stream is an unnamed ripple. It's not even big enough to be counted as a rapid. It's the biggest thing I've ever hit before in a raft.
A few more miles and we pass under the Navajo bridge. A condor sits on the girders underneath it, hidden from view from the tourists above. It's the last time we'll see cars for a very long time.
We camp just below Badger Rapid. It's a confusing jumble of giant waves, loud as a jet engine, but as I lie in my tent, it fades to soft white noise.
We hit Soap Creek Rapid early the next day, and it's a mess. Three people swim- tossed from our giant rafts and tiny watercraft by the power of the giant waves. My anxiety about the rapids increases, even though our boat had a smooth line. Next up is our first massive rapid- House Rock. Before we left Flagstaff, the outfitter warned us about three rapids that are especially tricky at low water. House Rock, Bedrock and Upset all increase significantly in difficulty, making what are normally 7 and 8 rated rapids on a scale of 10 closer to 9 and 10s. We scout House Rock as a group, and I feel a cactus spike through my drysuit as we walk to the overlook.
House Rock is terrifying. We follow the lead boat down, even though he skirts far too close to a massive hole. We look down into the hole as we glide past- it looks like it could eat our boat whole.
I'm starting to regret my decision to come, but then we hit the Roaring Twenties and it's fun. The twenties are a series of short, sometimes sharp, rapids. There's a few rapids that hide something nasty- one boat gets hit pretty hard at a rapid named Indian Dick, but for the most part, they are easy and we start to hit our stride. I no longer have a death grip on the raft's straps. Instead, I start to relax and enjoy myself.
We reach Redwall Cavern at lunch time. It's the first spot we've been to that features more than just the sheer cliffs of the canyon and it's beautiful. I sit towards the back and stare out at the canyon, perfectly framed by the walls of the cavern. This is why I'm here- white water does not interest me, but spots like this make everything else worth while.
We take our first layover day at Nankoweap. It's nice to relax for a day- we do laundry, bathe in the river, and hike up to some old granaries high on the canyon wall. The river looks breathtaking from so high up.
We leave Nankoweap on the edge of a storm. The wind kicks up, so powerful that we have to row just to keep moving. We float past the confluence with the Little Colorado, but it's too windy and rainy to stop for more than a few seconds.
Massive eddies fill the river after the confluence. The river seems to have gone mad- at times the whole thing looks like it flows up stream. Finding the current is almost impossible- boats circle up and down stream, powerless to do more than hope that they can break free from the eddies on the next rotation.
The canyon opens up as we near camp at Cardenas. The storm pauses for a short stretch and rays of golden light filter between the clouds. This is a wild place- so different from the tight walls of Marble Canyon, but so coldly beautiful.
The storm blows itself out overnight. We run Hance in the sun. It's the first 8 that we have done, and my fear comes rushing back. We go over the pour over at the top sideways, setting us up to hit almost the entire wave train at exactly the wrong angle. We look down into troughs deeper than I am tall, and then up at giant standing waves towering over us. Somehow we make it through. This is only an 8. What will the 10s be like?
We camp above Grapevine rapid. We're in the upper Granite gorge now, and even the rocks are terrifying. Dark, jagged shist juts above the camp, blocking the sun. Even though the rocks are menacing, the camp is still one of the most beautiful we've seen so far. It will remain one of my favourites for the entire trip.
Grapevine is the first rapid we hit in the morning. The boat captains scouted in the night before, but the water level has dropped, exposing new hazards. We see the boat in front hit a hole and Jerami pulls hard to avoid it. The boat behind is not so lucky, and are surfed hard enough that one person is knocked from the boat. She easily self rescues, but it's a reminder of the power of the river.
We stop at Phantom Ranch long enough to mail a few postcards. Their water is shut off, dashing our hopes of a flush toilet. Some people buy beer, but the next rapid is looming large in our minds and it's not long before we hit the river again.
Of all the rapids we run, Horn Creek looks the most menacing. Many others have bigger water, but Horn just looks evil. One of our guide books says the rapid is not recommended at water levels below 10,000 cfs. We're pretty sure the river is at 7,000. We glide down the smooth tongue into the maelstrom below. The water rockets us towards the canyon wall. Jerami loses his grip on the oars for a split second, but he pulls hard, and we are through. We camp a few miles downstream, above Granite rapid.
Tomorrow will be a big day. Two of the rapids we will hit are rated 8, and then there is Crystal, a 9 or 10 depending on the water. Unbeknown to us though, it will be a much smaller rapid downstream from all of those that will give us the most trouble.
Still trying to figure out how to get my pictures on my ipad- until then, have some photos from Horshoe Overlook, a few miles upstream from Lee's Ferry.
