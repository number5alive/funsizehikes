Ultralight and canoe gear might seem like a contradiction. What’s the point in going lightweight when you have a 40 pound canoe to carry? Still, we’ve managed to find a balance that allows us to travel fast and light on canoe expeditions.

Ultralight and canoe gear might seem like a contradiction. What’s the point in going lightweight when you have a 40 pound canoe to carry? Still, we’ve managed to find a balance that allows us to travel fast and light on canoe expeditions. My canoeing gear list is very similar to my thru-hiking list, with a few small differences. For one, base weight matters a lot less in a canoe, so it is much easier to bring a book or some camp shoes. I also canoe with my husband, so we share a two person tent. We use this gear for multi-day trips in Algonquin Park. While we can bring heavier stuff, we do try and keep our packs ultralight. This makes portages much easier. Crossing a 5km portage in one trip is much better than having to go back and forth multiple times! Shake ‘n Bake carries the canoe on portages, so I take extra shared gear to make up for it. I normally carry the tent and most of the food as a result.
