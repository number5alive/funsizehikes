I've heard bad things about Paris, even before the terrorist attacks. It's dirty. It's smelly. The people are rude. As I get on the plane, I'm a little worried I've picked a bad first destination. Never mind all of the horrific events that we missed while we were on the river.

I don't expect to fall in love with Paris, but it charms me. I leave the Metro at Blanche, and immediately step onto a street of neon and cabaret shows. The Moulin Rouge looms monstrous over the street. Maybe I have made a mistake.
But just one block up the street, Montmartre turns quaint- tiny Boulangers, little restaurants and florists. The pale stone buildings shine in the winter light and the wrought iron balconies look like every post card of France.
I drop my bag at the hostel on Rue D'Abbess and immediately climb Montmartre Butte up to the Sacre Cour. The view over Paris is bewitching and I forget about my jetlag.
Over the next few days I wander around Paris. I go to all of the tourist sites- Notre Dame, Eiffel Tower, the Louvre. My favourite is the Musee D'Orsay, with its Monets and Manets, Van Goghs and Renoirs. I explore the manicured parks and zig zag across the
Seine's bridges.

There's not a huge climate of fear, despite the recent events. There are lots of police and army with guns, especially in tourist areas. And to go inside any building, even a grocery store, you have to open your bag. But apart from that, it's hard to tell that anything has happened. I'm glad I came, even though I was worried about it.
