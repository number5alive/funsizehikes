It doesn't take long before I'm twitchy in town- I wake up in the hotel room completely disoriented, thinking I'm back on the night float and we've drifted into a cave. We spend a day running errands, then sleep at a friend's house outside of Flagstaff. In the morning, we say goodbye to the last people remaining in town from our trip, then drive north towards Lake Powell. Most of the drive is the same route as the one we took to Lee's Ferry almost a month ago, and we're instantly homesick for the canyon. We stop at Horseshoe overlook a few miles north of Lee's Ferry and hike out to the rim. There are people everywhere, and that's more of a culture shock than being in town. For 24 days, the canyon was ours alone- no more than a handful of people on the river at the same time as us. The canyon is still beautiful though and I think back to the first few days of our trip, with smooth walls rising above us and clear blue water.

We head north, stoping at Glen Canyon dam. It's getting dark- we'll explore properly in the morning. We stopped at Hoover Dam before our trip, but Glen Canyon holds far more attraction for me, both because of the Emerald Mile, and because it controlled the water levels for us for 24 days.
We camp at Lake Powell. It's weird to be in an organized camp ground, but the stars and moonlight are the same as ever. It's good to be back in a tent, although the howling coyotes are a new experience.
The next morning, we try to find somewhere to rent a boat. The lady at the Marina will only rent power boats- the water apparently too cold for kayaks. I dip my hand in the lake- it's warm enough that I'd consider swimming.
Instead we drive back towards the Glen Canyon dam. They're about to give a tour. We walk out onto the top of the dam, and then descend to the bottom, checking out the power plant. Jerami asks questions about the flood of 1983, the flood that spawned a record breaking run down the Grand.
On the way out, we spot an advert for another marina, next to Antelope Canyon. They have a cheap boat tour. We decide to go check it out.
When we arrive, we find a lady perfectly willing to rent us kayaks, no matter what the temperature is. We kayak out to Antelope Canyon. We have the entire place to ourselves, and as we paddle, the walls close in around us. It's not the most impressive slot canyon we've seen in the past month, but it's still beautiful.
We drive out of Page as it's starting to get dark. We find somewhere to camp just a mile outside of Zion National Park. Deer surround our tent- Jerami calls to them the way you'd try and call a cat.
