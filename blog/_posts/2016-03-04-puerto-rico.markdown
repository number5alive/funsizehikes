Piecing together my flight home was like solving Jig saw puzzle. Norwegian would only fly to certain US cities and they would not connect with any US airlines. I'd need a layover somewhere of at least 12 hours, and if I was going to have to go through security anyway, it might as well be somewhere I wanted to visit so I could leave the airport.
And so I booked a flight from Rome to Madrid. An overnight layover in Madrid, and then a flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Five days later, and I'd fly to Anchorage.

For such awful connections, the Norwegian flight is incredible. The newest plane I've been on the whole trip flies buttery smooth over the atlantic. I doze, unable to believe that a transatlantic flight only cost me $300. I feel like I've gone back in time, to before oil prices soared and the price of airline tickets climbed like a jet taking off.
And then I'm back on US soil. A taxi takes me to a hostel in Old Town San Juan as I fight jet lag and sleep deprivation from my night in the airport the night before.

I am awake obscenely early, before the heat of the day smothers everything. I walk the streets of Old San Juan and it is impossible to put my camera away. Bright buildings put Copenhagen's Nyhavn to shame. Wooden doors are interspersed with street art and stray cats wind their way between my legs as I climb the hill to El Morro.

The forts of El Morro and San Christobel protected Puerto Rico for centuries. I wander through cool hallways and meander through sun drenched courtyards where plaster crumbles under the combined assault of sun, wind and salt spray.

After a lunch of mofongo (mashed plantains with ground beef), I wait out the sun. As the day cools, I walk along coastal walls, watching the waves break over the rocky coast. A tarantula dozes by the walkway- as immobilized by the heat as I am.

I split my time in San Juan between the old town and a locals beach that I find. $2 Medalla cerveza and palm trees bending in the breeze fill me with a tranquility that I haven't found in Europe's busy streets. I soak up the heat, bracing myself to return to Alaska's cold.
