excerpt: It's not sitting at my desk that makes me happy. It's not even promotions
  and raises. It's the two weeks vacation, the weekend warrior trips. It's stumbling
  into the office jetlagged and sleep deprived. It's standing on top of a mountain,
  then limping in the next day with scratches and bruises.

Over the past six years, I have saved as much money as possible. I haven't had a car. No smart phone. No TV. Now my bank account, while by no means full, is full enough for a few months of thrifty travel. I'm paring down my belongings, booking flights and getting ready to go explore.

When I look back over my short working life, it's not sitting at my desk that makes me happy. It's not even promotions and raises. It's the two weeks vacation, the weekend warrior trips. It's stumbling into the office jetlagged and sleep deprived. It's standing on top of a mountain, then limping in the next day with scratches and bruises. I am hoping that the next few months will be an exercise in maximizing these experiences, to make the next stint at a desk more bearable.

I'm terrified, but not of the things they expect me to be afraid of. I'm not scared of getting lost, robbed, or not speaking the language. I'm scared of not making the most of my time, of not doing what I really want to do because it is difficult, or dangerous, or not what is considered normal. I hope I'll remember that when I'm having a tough day or feeling homesick.
The pictures in this post are from my trip to Thailand this spring. There's a bit of a story there. On arrival in Bangkok, it was discovered there was a problem with the passport I'd been travelling on for nine years. It had been misprinted, and had some duplicate and some missing pages. No one had caught it up until Thai immigration, who were not impressed. They were ready to deport me, but after multiple calls to the embassy, a lot of arguing and two days of being unable to leave the airport, I was given an emergency passport and allowed into the country. It is a lot easier to be brave about travelling when I remind myself that things like that have already happened and I survived.
So, on October 24th, we'll fly to Las Vegas. From there, we drive to Flagstaff and spend a month rafting the Grand Canyon. We'll kick around the South West, exploring national parks, until early December. Then, I'll say goodbye to Jerami and fly to Paris. From there, Copenhagen, Scotland and England are all in my plans.
