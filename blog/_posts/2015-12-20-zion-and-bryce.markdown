We arrive at Zion early, before the fee station is open. There's no self pay option, so we just go on in. We stop at an overlook trail and hike for a mile, up the side of a canyon, through a small cavern, until we reach the overlook. Zion Canyon is laid out below us and it's beautiful- so different from anything we've seen in the Grand Canyon.

We drive down to the ranger station to check the weather. It's going to rain. We decide to go do some hikes that don't involve slot canyons or exposure. The shuttle service isn't running, so we drive down the scenic road. It's a zoo. Finding parking is almost impossible. We finally find a spot at the Weeping Rock trail head. We hike up to a hanging garden. We decide to continue on to Hidden Canyon. It's up the side of the mountain, but our legs feel good. Then we come to a narrow rock ledge with chains along side it. I grip the chains tightly and try not to look down. We're through to the start of the canyon. There's a sign warning that the trail is not maintained beyond this point, and that scrambling is required to reach an arch farther down the canyon. Next to the word scrambling, someone has scratched the word major. Surely it can't be worse than the ledge with the chains?

We reach the arch with no problem. Either the Grand Canyon hikes have increased my tolerance of sketchy scrambling, or the person who added to that sign was being dramatic. We make our way back down to the trailhead as clouds grow overhead.
The sky opens as we're hiking back to the start of the narrows. Hail pounds down. I'm glad we stayed out of the slot canyon.
We drive back to Zion Lodge. Jerami isn't feeling well and wants to nap. I ask if he wants to go back to the tent. He just wants to sleep in the car. There's a trailhead across the street. Might as well....
I hike up to the Emerald Pools alone, apart from the crowds of people on the trail. It's a pretty series of cascading pools, with waterfalls between them and a hanging garden at the top. I race back down the trail, dodging small children and old ladies. Jerami is still asleep - I needn't have hurried.

It's a cold night at the campground and we huddle together. If we zip our sleeping bags together, we can add a few extra degrees of warmth.
In the morning, dark clouds cloud creep over the mountains. We pack up the tent and get ready to leave the park. As we leave the campground, fat flakes of snow fall from the sky. We're giddy with excitement- 8 years in Alaska hasn't lessened my love of snow.
We stop for coffee just outside the park and check the weather at Bryce Canyon. It's going to be cold- a low of 7 and highs in the 20s. We only have 20 degree bags. It's going to have to be a flying visit.
Half of the park is closed anyway when we get there. There's a few inches of powder and the road is slick. The rental car is unhappy about the hills, but Jerami gently coaxes it up. We're soon at the overlook.

Bryce looks like Christmas- white snow blankets red rocks, dotted with green pines. It's beautiful, but the park is closing up for winter. We walk along the rim a little, then jump back in the car, chasing warmer temperatures.
We don't get far before we're distracted again, by Petrified Wood State Park. Jerami's in heaven, searching among the rocks along the trail for fossils and wood. The wood is beautiful- vivid purples, reds and yellows instead of greens and browns.

We drive on into the dusk. The sun sets as the road becomes wild, dipping into a canyon made of beehive rock formations, then rising to run along a ridge the width of the road, with drop offs of hundreds of feet on either side.
In the dark, we're guided by the cars thermometer as to where to camp. We ascend, rising quickly and the temperature drops. It's at 12 degrees, and I'm worried- we'll be very cold tonight. Then we crest the hill and a sign proclaims the elevation to be 9,600 feet. Well, that explains it. We drop back down, and the temperature rises. It reaches 28 degrees at Capitol Reef state park and we pull into the campground. In the morning, there's a dusting of snow on our tent.
We drive towards Moab, and Arches and Canyonland National Parks. We stop in Green River for groceries. We know the Green feeds into the Colorado. For as much anxiety as that river put me through, I'm excited to be getting close to it again. We drive on, the landscape changing as we near Moab. We pass Arches, and then there it is, the Colorado. We cheer, like we're greeting an old friend. We find a campspot along the river. There's even a little ripple- rapid noise!
