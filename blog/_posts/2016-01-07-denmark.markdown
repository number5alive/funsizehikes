Traveling is so different when you know someone in a city. I meet Alison, who spent three years in Denmark. My time in Copenhagen is very different because of her. I meet Danish people (generous, kind, but very loud when they are drunk) and try the best Danish foods.

While Paris is big and classy, Copenhagen is small and trendy. I meet Alison at the train station. I'm glad to have someone to travel with, even though I love traveling on my own. It's reassuring to have someone else to help when you get lost, or need to figure out train times.
We spend a day exploring a few castles. We go to Frederiksborg Slot and spend hours wandering the dark and drafty castle. Danish castles are very different to Scottish castles, with their copper roofs and more polished interiors. After Frederiksborg, we go out to Kronborg Slot, which was Hamlet's castle. It's getting dark when we arrive, and the castle broods over the sea. We walk around the outside in the howling wind and imagine Hamlet sulking inside.

We take a day trip to Malm√∂, Sweden. It's rainy, and we meet a friend of Alison's for lunch. All of Alison's friends are welcoming and generous, greatly influencing my opinion of Denmark.
We visit Roskilde and the Viking ships there, and duck inside the cathedral right as it's closing to see the tombs of Danish kings and queens.

We tour Christiansborg, which quickly becomes my favorite castle. I adore the Picasso-esque tapestries in the reception room. Alison is less convinced.

We visit the normal tourist attractions- the little mermaid and Tivoli. Tivoli is all lit up for Christmas. We drink glog and eat Aebelskiver. Aebelskiver are like little donuts, eaten with powdered sugar and jam, and consumed with Glog.
