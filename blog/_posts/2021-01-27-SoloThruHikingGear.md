This is my go-to thru-hiking gear. I carried a lot of this gear on the Long Trail, Appalachian Trail and Continental Divide Trail. I did use different gear on the Pacific Crest Trail, but the gear I carry now is definitely an upgrade.

This is my go-to thru-hiking gear. I carried a lot of this gear on the Long Trail, Appalachian Trail and Continental Divide Trail. I did use different gear on the Pacific Crest Trail, but the gear I carry now is definitely an upgrade. The contents of my pack varies a little based on the trail and the season. My base weight is roughly ten pounds: I don’t track it too accurately. As long as it’s not much above ten pounds, I’m a happy camper. Ultralight gear is important to me, but not to the point of sacrificing comfort! If I hike with my husband, I swap out the tarp for our Big Agnes Copper Spur.
