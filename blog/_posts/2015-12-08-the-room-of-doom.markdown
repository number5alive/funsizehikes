Bass camp is sunny and there are great hikes from the camp. We head up Shimuno wash, looking for waterfalls. We see the most impressive ones from above, and then we're in the wash itself, heading towards old Bass camp, where we find old camping paraphernalia- a coffee pot, a stove door, a pick. Then it's back down to camp. I try to patch my drysuit, using almost an entire tube of aquaseal in the process. It's hard to keep it clean- sand is everywhere on the Grand Canyon, and despite my best efforts, there's some on the patch.

Grover view at Bass.
Layover day over, it's back on the river. There's a small rapid, just down from camp. Normally I wouldn't even bother holding on, but I'm terrified. Ruby really knocked my confidence- not in Jerami's rowing, but in the ability of the boats to handle the big water. I have a death grip on the straps, and I'm constantly scanning the water for hidden holes.
I've relaxed a little by the time we reach Elves Chasm- a hike up to a pretty waterfall. Jerami jumps from the falls into the pool below. Then it's back on the rafts until we reach Blacktail narrows. Blacktail Narrows is one of my favourite side canyons on the entire trip- rivaled only by Havasu. The rock formations are incredible, and so are the acoustics. The more musically talented members of our party whistle and sing and it sounds fantastic.

We camp at Fossil campground and don't bother setting up our tent. It's a dewy night, but sleeping under the stars is beautiful. This starts a streak of sleeping out without a tent of over a week. Every night, we see so many shooting stars that we lose count.
The next day is a big rapid day. We run Specter, Bedrock and Dubendorf. Specter and Dubendorf are both fine, but the middle rapid, Bedrock, is one of the three we were warned about at low water. A massive rock splits the river in two, with a nasty hole in the middle and a current strong enough to wrap you around the rock. Almost all of the current goes left, into a mysterious channel that we call the room of doom. We've heard various things about it- a huge eddy that recirculates you endlessly, bashing you against rock walls. There's no way out- you have to be lined out. There's no way to verify what we've heard. The left channel is entirely hidden from the scout. It's imperative that everyone runs right.
This is one of the few rapids with a walk around and I sit on the shore. The first two boats barely make the right hand run, the captains pulling as hard as they can. Then it's Jerami's turn. I can't watch. Liz stands next to me, giving me the play by play. Then she goes silent. "They've gone behind the rock."
It seems like an eternity passes. We can't see anything from shore. The only clue we have to what is happening is Helen, perched on top of the rock that she snuck around in her kayak. After a minute she shrugs nonchalantly. "They're fine." She yells over the rush of the river. I'm not reassured, but a second later, I see a head in the split in the bottom of the rock. A few minutes later and they are out. Jerami is as poker faced as ever, but on the shore, we cheer and scream.
After that, Dubendorf seems easy. We camp under cloudy skies, and it spits rain before dawn. I pull the tent fly around us like a blanket, too lazy to set up the tent.

Once it's light, the skies open. We pass through the narrowest part of the canyon, where the granite walls close in around us, dark and menacing. Hail bounces off our helmets, and the wind blows so strongly it actually pushes up river. We are lucky to find a camp with overhanging rock to sleep under, across the river from beautiful Deer Creek Falls.
